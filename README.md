# Web Development Project 5 - *Data Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Amy Wong**

This web app: **This dashboard displays the search results from A Court of Thorns and Roses from the Open Library API. It includes
the search results, summary statistics, and certain features such as search and filter.**

Time spent: **16** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
- [x] **Data uses the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data such as**
  - [x] *the total number books listed for ACOTAR*
  - [x] *the earliest year that was published from the list*
  - [x] *the author that pops up the most from the list (mode)*
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [x] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [ ] Filters use different input types such as a text input, a selection, or a slider
- [ ] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

I'm still getting used to working with APIs and implementing them to my websites. Though my biggest challenge with this project
is definitely making sure that the search bar and filters filtered out the results for when a user types a keyword. It geninutely took me more than 3 hours on just that portion of the project.
